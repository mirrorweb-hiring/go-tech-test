# Go Tech Test

## üéõÔ∏è Overview

Welcome to the MirrorWeb Go Tech Test! We'd like to see how you approach building out some new functionality suitable for a production setting.

This repository is a fairly sparse place but should contain everything you need to get started. Open up emaildomainstats.go for instructions.

## Notes

- Please endevour to use the the standard library only.
- This tech test is not intended to take a significant amount of your time up so please factor this into your solution. If you have ideas for how this could be expanded upon, improved or compromises you decided on during the test make a note of them. They can be good to discuss in your interview.

## Submitting your work

To complete the tech test you will need to clone down this GitHub repo, create a feature branch from main and do all of your work from this branch, create a single PR with all your changes back into main. When you‚Äôre ready, share your submission back with us, ideally via a private Github repository with the PR open so we can schedule it for review. We review submissions as quickly as possible. You‚Äôll hear back from us no matter what.

Remember, we are not timing you and there is no deadline. Work at your own pace. Reach out if you're stuck or have any questions. We want you to succeed and are here to help! We won't give you much in the way of hints, but we can at least help you orient yourself about the challenge!
